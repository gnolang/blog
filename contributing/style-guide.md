This style guide offers rules and preferences for contributing to the Gno Blog. 
Below are some rules to follow when writing a blog post.

1. All Gno Blog posts are written in standard Markdown. Follow the formatting for headers, links, bold, italic, strikethrough, etc. as you usually would.
2. Check your content for spelling and grammatical mistakes before submitting.
3. Use the Oxford comma.
4. Make sure the target reader is addressed consistently.
5. Make sure the product, company, tech, and other names are accurate.
6. Fact-check your content.
7. If your post contains images, please add a `src` folder to contain them, and link to them in Markdown.
8. Include front-matter in your blog post, detailing the following:
   1. title,
   2. publication_date,  
   3. slug,
   4. tags,
   5. authors.
