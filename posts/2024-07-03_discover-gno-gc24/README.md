# Discover gno.land at GopherCon US: Embrace Interpreted Go

If you're attending GopherCon US this year, you may have heard about the 
[Challenge Series](https://www.gophercon.com/agenda/session/1281366) happening 
during the conference. In addition to a the core set of challenges focused on 
software engineering and cybersecurity provided by the Challenge Series organizers,
the engineers at gno.land have brewed up a series of challenges that will introduce
you to blockchains and smart contracts, while still feeling right at home by 
creating your solutions as Go and Gno programs!

In the challenges, you'll learn how you can interact with a blockchain and discover
how realms (smart contracts) can be utilized for stateful applications without 
relying on a filesystem or a database. You'll also be able to leverage gno.land's
features, such as using deployed contracts both as an API and as importable Gno 
programs, while being aware of their limitations, like not being able to access 
the system's time. And finally, you'll see what class of security problems come 
up when you want to make smart contracts. Luckily, there are no SQL injections 
to worry about here.

## What is gno.land and Gno?

gno.land is a distributed multiuser language-based operating system based on Go.
It embeds a custom-built virtual machine that interprets and executes the Gno 
language - a fully deterministic variant of Go. Set to become the leading 
open-source smart contract platform, gno.land allows gophers to create 
decentralized applications with a minimal learning curve.

## How to Get Started

You will be able to find the Gno challenges among the full catalogue on the 
[Challenge Series website](https://gophercon.challengeseries.org/). There you
will also find a guide that the engineers at gno.land have put together to help
you get started, covering essential concepts and environment setup. This guide 
will provide you with the tools and knowledge you need to effectively participate
in solving Gno challenges.

To participate, you'll have to form a team. You can join up with a team or look 
for teammates by reaching out on the #gophercon-cs channel in the 
[Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/). We suggest 4-5 people 
per team.

Of course, it wouldn't be a competition without prizes! The winning team will
score four tickets to GopherCon 2025, the second-place team will get gift cards
for new hacking hardware, and the third-place team will receive copies of 
"Go Programming: From Beginner to Professional" by Samantha Coyle, along with 
cash prizes for all three top teams. We also have nine individual Achievement 
awards, such as "First Blood!", "Night Owl!" and "Hooked on the Sidequest!", 
each with a one-year subscription to 2600 Magazine and $100 in Google Cloud
Platform credits. Plus, everyone who completes a challenge is eligible for 
random prizes like vintage 2600 Magazine issues and security and programming 
books, to be awarded to those present at the prize ceremony on Wednesday. The 
full list of prizes can be found on the [website](https://gophercon.challengeseries.org/).
