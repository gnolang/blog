# Gnomes spotted in Seoul: Our onsite collaboration with Onbloc

gno.land’s core engineering team has just concluded an intense and productive 
two-week coding sprint with our core contributor, [Onbloc](https://onbloc.xyz).
Hosted in Onbloc's offices in the heart of Seoul, this onsite collaboration has 
marked one of our most successful development cycles yet, setting new records for 
pull requests merged and advancing key priorities for our upcoming mainnet launch.

To provide greater transparency into our progress, we’ve been updating the Seoul
triage board on GitHub, which showcases the scope and depth of the work achieved 
during this cycle. The onsite collaboration kicked off with the launch of test5,
the first contributor-initiated testnet in the project’s history, and set the 
momentum for a productive two-weeks.

In addition to the coding sprint, Onbloc and our engineering team hosted an 
informal meetup to connect with Seoul’s strong developer community. The event
drew over 15 developers, eager to learn more about gno.land’s vision and how 
they can contribute. Attendees had the unique opportunity to hear directly from 
the core team about the technical innovations we’re building and their potential
to address some of the most pressing societal challenges in the current digital 
landscape. Topics and questions discussed during the meetup included:

- Why gno.land’s architecture is unique and how it enables innovative smart 
contracts and decentralized applications. 
- Opportunities for developers to contribute to gno.land, from protocol-level 
engineering to building on the platform.
- Decentralized governance challenges and how gno.land plans to tackle them.
- Use cases for the Gno language and its ability to simplify complex programming 
tasks in decentralized systems.
- Technical insights into the recent testnet launch and what’s next as we prepare
for the mainnet.

The two weeks spent in Seoul have not only accelerated our engineering milestones
but have also strengthened the bonds within our contributor network and community.
The enthusiasm from local developers and the collaboration with Onbloc highlights
the growing global momentum behind gno.land. gno.land aims to transcend regional 
and language barriers by providing opportunities to developer communities across 
the globe to contribute and get involved in our shared philosophy.

While the primary focus of the collaboration was focused on engineering, it also 
became a celebration of cultural exchange. Our gracious hosts at Onbloc made the 
experience extend beyond the office and GitHub, introducing the team to the rich 
culture of South Korea. From lively conversations over authentic Korean BBQ to 
spirited evenings of karaoke, and reflective visits to historical landmarks, 
the time in Seoul was enriching culturally, while underscoring the importance 
of team and community building.

As we look toward the mainnet launch, we hope to excite others about joining and
contributing to gno.land. It starts in the digital realm (no pun intended) and
expands to the human-centric focus of what we are building. We look forward to 
meeting more gnomes in-person in 2025.
