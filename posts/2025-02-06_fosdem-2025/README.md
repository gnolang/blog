# FOSDEM 2025: Gnomes Spotted

This past weekend, members of the gno.land team traveled to Brussels for FOSDEM
2025, one of the world’s largest and most influential open-source gatherings. 
This year marked FOSDEM’s 25th anniversary, drawing over 5,000 developers, 
engineers, and enthusiasts from across the globe.

Attending FOSDEM was inspiring, a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when 
people collaborate in a free, transparent, and open way. The depth of knowledge 
shared, the engaging discussions, and the sheer diversity of topics, from robotics
and simulations to the Go ecosystem, highlight the incredible breadth of 
open-source innovation, and what’s possible when people build together. It went
beyond code, FOSDEM was a first-hand experience to witness the global community
driven by a shared ethos.

## FOSDEM meets Gno

This year was particularly special for us, as we introduced gno.land to the 
FOSDEM community for the first time. During the Go lightning talks, Manfred 
Touron distilled the essence of Gno in just a few minutes, explaining why Gno,
the Gno paradigm, and how Go developers can easily start building with it. And 
simply put, what we’re building...

```
we're building a user-owned internet
where governance is fair,
development is open,
and innovation is rewarded.
```

## Bridging Open Source and Web3

Web3 often meets skepticism in traditional open-source circles, but gno.land’s 
100% open-source engineering bridges that gap. Throughout the weekend, we saw
direct connections between our work and key topics at FOSDEM, from governance 
models and Byzantine Fault Tolerance to consensus algorithms and the challenges 
of sustaining open-source projects. These are issues that extend beyond web3
and resonate with the broader open-source community.

A special thanks to all the organizers, presenters, and volunteers that made 
FOSDEM 2025 possible, and the opportunity to access information freely. See 
you next year!
