Game of Realms, the worldwide competition to find the best contributors to Gno.land, is currently underway. Unlike some contests you may have entered, we're doing things a little differently. We want participants to be instrumental in building the Gno.land platform with meaningful contributions that help shape the direction of the project – either by writing the best Gnolang smart contracts or contributing to the core blockchain. It’s not just about winning prizes but becoming a meaningful contributor. We encourage participants to collaborate on the challenges – your contribution will be rewarded on individual merit.

## Phase One: The Basics

Phase one of Game of Realms is about laying the foundations to onboard more people to the platform. You’ll need to be an advanced developer who wants to create core materials that power the platform every day. You should also be willing to document your work and even write tutorials and guides that help us advance to the second phase of the competition.

There is a total prize pool of 133,700 ATOM available during the Game of Realms competition, one-third of which (44,121 ATOM) will be allocated to contributions from phase one. During phase one, which we expect to last between 1-3 months, participants will open PRs against repos from the Gnolang organization. For additional information on the competition phases and timelines, be sure to check out the following resources:

## Phase One: The Challenges

**Evaluation DAO**: To ensure contributions in Game of Realms are rewarded fairly, we need an Evaluation DAO. Allowing community members to vote on the best contributions and decide how much they are worth provides a level playing field for all. We’re therefore seeking your skills in DAO development and implementation. This is one of the most important challenges of phase one and the only challenge that must be approved unilaterally by the core team because of its key role in the competition and the future of the platform. Read more about the [Evaluation DAO challenge on GitHub here](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/407).

**Tutorials & Documentation**: So that we can progress to phase two and open up the Gno.land platform to a broader audience, we need written and recorded tutorials, guides, and documentation from phase one participants. There are almost no instruction manuals when it comes to this new frontier as the only smart contract platform using the Gnolang programming language. Help us to create materials that will onboard more contributors to Gno.land. Read more about the [Tutorials & Documentation challenge on GitHub here](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/408).

**Governance Module**: We want Gno.land to adopt the fairest and most effective governance solution possible; one that encourages voter participation and is transparent and accountable. We’re looking for contributors to define and implement a governance contract suite that rivals existing ones, such as the Cosmos Hub, and be implemented by other projects. Can you improve on that? Show us how! Read more about the [Governance Module challenge on GitHub Here](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/409).

All phase one challenges will stay open during phase two. No competition points will be attributed during this phase as the points will be retro-funded by the Evaluation DAO and awarded during phase two.

## Judging Criteria - What Wins Points?

What will the judges be looking for when assessing contributions? You can find individual details on the corresponding GitHub issue regarding each challenge, but to get you started, the Game of Realms contest prioritizes communication and collaboration. We encourage participants to work together to find the best solutions. You will be awarded individually for your contribution but working as part of a team is highly valued. Good documentation that expresses high learning efficiency and shows how the task was completed in an educational way will also win additional points, as will a high standard of quality, great UX, and the ability to follow the contribution guidelines.

As this is primarily a developer-oriented competition, most of the organization for Game of Realms is happening on GitHub; come by the repo and [visit issue #408](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/408) to contribute to tutorial and documentation writing for Gno.land.

## Rules of Engagement

All participants must keep in mind a strict code of conduct and specific rules and criteria to ensure fair play. Throughout the Game of Realms competition, no plagiarism will be tolerated at any time. Participants may submit what they wish, however, any project that has already been allocated rewards or received compensation in any other hackathon or similar contest will not receive double pay.

That’s all for now. If you have more questions about Game of Realms or Gno.land you can join us in our next Office Hours session on Tuesday, March 14, 2023, at 4 pm UTC. You can also connect with other participants in the [Gnoland Discord](https://discord.com/invite/S8nKUqwkPn).

## Game of Realms Phase 1: FAQ

Below are some frequently asked questions about phase one of the Game of Realms competition. If you can’t find your answer below, jump into our Discord and ask, or join us for a live “Office Hours” session with the core team.

### Q. How are the tasks in the issues assigned?

A. There are official communication challenges that we encourage participants to use.

### Q. Can I work individually or should I work as part of a team?

A. You are free to work in stealth mode, but please keep in mind that you risk finishing too late or losing points for being bad at collaborating. We expect the issues in phase 1 to be done by multiple people, in multiple steps. But anyone can try to make everything in stealth mode and open a PR with everything.

### Q. How can I find collaborators?

A. Participate on the issue or in Discord by indicating your desire to participate, by sharing your ideas, reviewing others' work, giving feedback, clarifying, or whatever makes sense.

### Q. How can I ensure good collaboration?

A. Since we are fully remote, collaborating can be a challenge and the best collaborators will be rewarded. We don't know each other, so having good communication is key.

### Q. How will my collaboration be evaluated?

A. At the end of a big task, i.e. the Evaluation DAO is finished, the core team will take all the small contributions and identify contributors, and then suggest how to split the task prize. We'll propose the split and allow room for public negotiations.

### Q. How much is the prize pool?

A. There is a total prize pool of **133,700 ATOM** available during the Game of Realms competition, one-third of which (**44,121 ATOM**) will be allocated to contributions from phase one.

### Q. When will I receive my rewards for my collaboration?

A. Rewards will be allocated retroactively by the Evaluation DAO during phase 2.

### Q. Will there be a leaderboard and place where we can submit evidence for tasks?

A. Not yet. The leaderboard will come in phase 2.

### Q. What will the overall tasks consist of?

A. Here is a non-exhaustive list:

* Onboard more contributors (create tutorials and documentation)
* Improve the project and implement more things
* Bootstrap our genesis of contributors for the future mainnet
* Experiment with Proof of Contribution by having a simpler system: Evaluation DAO
* Identify the best participants to propose jobs
* Identify the best organizations to propose partnerships

### Q. Are there tasks for non-programmers?

A. There are more tasks for programmers, but multiple parts are for non-programmers too. During phase 1, the tasks are relatively well defined, please read this:

https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/390
https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/540

### Q. What are the requirements to start participating?

A. There is no requirement to start participating. You’ll need to do some KYC at the end of the competition to receive a prize. Feel free to fill out the form linked in the Register section of the following issue:

https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/390

This will allow us to contact you about the competition through our newsletter and set up prize payment later. Use the comment section of the issues or discuss them on Discord if you plan to work on specific tasks, so we can see that you’re actively working on a topic.

### Q. Is there a fixed period of time for phase 1?

A. No. Phase 1 will be finished when we consider that enough materials have been implemented to switch to phase 2.

### Q. Is it possible to install a local testnet to get a proper local development environment?

A. You can find the answer in this GitHub issue. Subscribe to the issue to get updates:

https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/478

### Q. Will there be a list of what needs to be tested? When will the tests start?

A. The best place to look is on GitHub here:

https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/390

During phase 1, there are 3 official focuses:

* Evaluation DAO
* Tutorials
* Governance Module

The competition was just announced, but we’ll review contributions made in the past, too, so it starts from the first commit, ~1-2 years ago.
