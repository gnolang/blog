# Introducing Gno Studio, the Premier Builder Suite for Gno.land

[![introduction-banner](https://gnolang.github.io/blog/gno-studio-intro/src/thumbs/introducing-gnostudio.png)](https://gnolang.github.io/blog/gno-studio-intro/src/introducing-gnostudio.png)

Exceptional developer experience is integral to the Gno ecosystem, shaping the 
special programming language, Gno, and guiding the features of Gno.land. The
technology stack is designed to offer developers an unparalleled platform for 
crafting next-generation dApps via realms (smart contracts).

As Gno.land expands into a universe of realms, development tools become 
instrumental to enable innovation and ingenuity. To fully realize this vision,
we are creating Gno Studio, empowering community members to create and use 
succinct and composable realms on Gno.land.

## The Gno Studio Developer Experience

The [Gno Studio](https://gno.studio/) suite will offer extensive builder tools tailored 
for Gno.land. The design of Gno Studio is intended to cater to a wide range of 
users, from experienced builders to non-coders, by simplifying and enhancing the 
process of launching any realm or application you can imagine. Initially, Gno 
Studio started as a proof of concept IDE (Integrated Development Environment). 
Eventually, this evolved into a vision for a comprehensive suite of apps and 
services — Gno Studio — designed to elevate the developer experience to new 
heights and meet users’ and builders’ current needs and expectations.

At the end of last year, we launched the first beta application of the Gno 
Studio suite, [Gno Playground](https://play.gno.land/), as part of the Gno.land brand. The 
official Playground of Gno.land is a minimalistic IDE that facilitates the 
creation, testing, deployment, and sharing of Gno code. It is a powerful tool 
designed to simplify the development of packages and realms, lowering the barrier
to entry for new builders and enhancing the productivity of advanced Go developers.

**Today, we are excited to announce the beta release of Gno Studio Connect, the 
second application in the Gno Studio suite.**

## Your Gateway to Experience the Power of Realms

Gno Studio Connect is a tool that simplifies access and interaction with realm 
functions. Whether you’re exploring realms like the Gno.land [blog](https://gno.land/r/gnoland/blog), 
engaging with a realm deployed through the [Gno Playground](https://play.gno.land/), or using a 
tool like [gnokey](https://docs.gno.land/gno-tooling/cli/gno-tooling-gnokey/), Connect makes interaction easy.

The initial version of Connect focuses on function calls, enabling users to 
interact with any realm’s exposed function(s) on Gno.land. Function calls are 
performed through your account using any wallet that supports Gno.land 
(currently, [Adena](https://www.adena.app/) is the only supported wallet.) Let’s discuss the
feature set:

- **Access**: Directly input a realm path and select the corresponding network 
in the interface for seamless navigation to your realm.
- **Explore**: Discover the available functions of any realm and their details 
through a dedicated function list.
- **Interact**: Swiftly make calls through a dedicated function interface by 
selecting a specific function in the realm’s function list.
- **Evaluate**: Review and analyze the outcomes of your interactions with realm
functions by assessing results and determine any further actions required.
- **Share:** Copy links to realms, functions and results and share with 
anyone, making it easy to request engagement on a realm or feedback on a specific function.
- **Track**: Keep track of your previous realm interactions, where you can view 
the results of your function calls and revisit their results through a historical overview.

## Get Started with Connect: Vote in a Simple Poll

[![vote-gnoyourdate](https://gnolang.github.io/blog/gno-studio-intro/src/thumbs/vote-gnoyourdate.png)](https://gnolang.github.io/blog/gno-studio-intro/src/vote-gnoyourdate.png)

Let’s dive into a hands-on example with a simple polling realm. First, click 
[here](https://gno.studio/connect/view/gno.land/r/gnostudio/gnoyourdate?network=test3#Vote) to access the ‘gnoyourdate’ poll. Once you’ve ensured that Adena 
wallet is connected, here’s what to do next:  

1. Select when you first heard about Gno.land:   
   - This month  
   - This year  
   - One or two years ago  
   - Since inception  
   - _Ensure your chosen option is marked as 'True (Yes)' and all others as 'False (No)' to validate your vote._  
2. After making your selection, hit the ‘Call’ button to execute the transaction
via your [Adena wallet](https://www.adena.app/). If you need help getting set up,
you can visit the [Adena docs](https://docs.adena.app/user-guide/sign-in).  
3. You’re ready to share your vote! Click ‘Copy result link’ and post it on X,
tagging [@_gnostudio](https://twitter.com/_gnostudio) and using the hashtag #gnoyourdate.  

## Share Your Feedback on Connect

We value your input as we continue developing Gno Studio. Please contribute to
our improvement efforts by interacting with our feedback form created as a realm.
Use the ‘[SubmitFeedback](https://gno.studio/connect/view/gno.land/r/gnostudio/feedback_v1?network=test3&tab=functions#SubmitFeedback)’ function to share your feedback with us.

If you have questions or comments, hop over to the [Gno.land Discord](https://discord.gg/FpKNhW5GK6) and 
follow us on [X](https://twitter.com/_gnostudio) for updates and discussions.

## The Gno Studio Outlook

The outlook for Gno Studio is full speed ahead with a roadmap bursting with 
exciting features and tools. We will continue to transition the beta applications,
Gno Playground and Gno Studio Connect, into their production versions while 
focusing on the development of the next set of tooling.

Development is already underway on a full-featured IDE that will provide a 
state-of-the-art workspace designed for realm and package development on Gno.land.
The IDE will consist of an advanced code editor, debugging tools, and a dedicated 
project management and deployment environment.

The next piece of the puzzle is a marketplace with ready-to-use templates that 
make creating apps more accessible to everyone. This collection of boilerplate 
code is targeted at speeding up deployment timelines and allowing non-coders to 
try their hand at launching realms without needing to worry about technical 
details.

The production-ready Gno Studio suite will help and inspire everyone with an idea,
coders and non-coders alike, to participate in the exciting innovations of Web3 
spurred by the next generation of realm applications on Gno.land.
