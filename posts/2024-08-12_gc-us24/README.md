# gno.land at GopherCon US 2024

GopherCon US is one of the largest events for the Go programming community.
This year, in the vibrant city of Chicago, we had the honor of being the Diamond
Sponsor at GopherCon US 2024. From July 7th to July 10th, we were surrounded by 
top Go talent; it was an incredible opportunity for us to connect with developers,
showcase our innovations, and share our expertise.

GopherCon US 2024 was held at the stunning McCormick Place, bringing together
nearly one thousand Go enthusiasts from around the world. Our team was thrilled
to be part of this gathering, contributing to the vibrant ecosystem of Go
developers.

## Highlights of our collaboration

### Jae’s Talk

Jae Kwon, the founder of gno.land, gave a talk on “**Gno: Lessons in Building a
Go Interpreter in Go.**”

Jae’s talk provided an in-depth overview of why this technology is gaining 
traction in the development community. The discussion began with the key reasons
to use Gno, and its seamless interoperability which allows for effortless 
integration. Detailed comparisons were made between Gno and other prominent
programming languages such as Solidity and Rust which are running other smart 
contract platforms, showcasing Gno’s distinct advantages. The strengths of the
GnoVM were a focal point, particularly its stack based AST architecture, its 
auto persistence, as well as its determinism and other features. The presentation
also shared valuable lessons learned from GnoVM's development and implementation,
offering insights into best practices and challenges overcome in the future work.

### Gno workshop

Participants had the opportunity to dive deep into the development process, 
guided by our expert engineer **[Dylan Boltz](https://github.com/deelawn)** who hosted a workshop on Community 
Day: **Building a decentralized app on gno.land**. The workshop provided practical 
insights and step-by-step guidance, empowering attendees to start building their
own applications. If you missed our workshop or want to revisit the session, you 
can find a recorded version of the workshop [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwL2VyjaV-A).

### The gno.land Booth
One of the most rewarding feelings about attending these kinds of conferences
is watching our booth quickly become a hub of activity, drawing a steady stream 
of visitors intrigued by our project. We engaged with developers from various 
backgrounds, answering a myriad of questions about Gno, gno.land, our company, 
and the company’s [open employment opportunities](https://jobs.lever.co/allinbits).
Having all of this direct human interaction was not only informative but also
deeply insightful, providing us with valuable feedback and ideas. For more

### The Gno Raffle

One of the major attractions at our booth, amongst the “gnome” beanie hat as 
well as the T-shirts, was the raffle for a high-end mechanical keyboard. The 
raffle participants had a direct opportunity to interact with gno.land by 
following the raffle instructions, leading them to use [Gno Playground](https://play.gno.land/) to import
and deploy a smart contract raffle realm from their own laptop. The excitement 
was palpable as attendees eagerly gathered for the drawing. The raffle not only 
drew crowds, but also sparked numerous engaging conversations that led to Go 
engineers giving Gno a try.

### The Challenge Series

This year we had the privilege to participate in a collaborative partnership
with the CodePro team to build the [challenge series](https://gophercon.challengeseries.org/). This collaboration was an
opportunity for participants to learn how to interact with blockchain and 
discover how realms (smart contracts) can be utilized for stateful applications
without relying on explicitly managing a file system or database. This was an 
opportunity to showcase gno.land’s features, like using a deployed contract as
both an API and as an import for other contracts.

## Conclusion

Overall, the enthusiasm of the attendees at GopherCon was infectious, and we 
were delighted to see such a high level of engagement and curiosity. Whether 
it was at our booth, during the raffle, or in the workshop, the interactions
were meaningful and enriching. Sponsoring and collaborating at GopherCon US 
2024 was an unforgettable experience. We are grateful for the opportunity to 
connect with the Go community, share our knowledge, and learn from fellow 
developers. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who visited our booth,
participated in the raffle, attended Jae Kwon's presentation on Gno, and joined 
our workshop.
