# The More You Gno 16

In this edition of *The More You Gno*, we're highlighting progress made during
the recent *Just Make* sprint (still ongoing), the release of Test8 (a closed 
testnet for performance testing), and what’s coming next as we move closer to a
Beta Mainnet release candidate.

## 'Just Make' Gno.land

The kick off of the *Just Make* initiative gave a significant push toward Beta
Mainnet readiness. Seventeen team members, partners, and contributors gathered
in person, many more supported remotely, to identify and fast-track the remaining 
Beta Mainnet scope.

During the first-phase with the in-person sprint, the team completed around 65% 
of the outstanding work required for the Beta launch. Most pending pull requests 
were reviewed, with a few important ones like the [`std split`](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/4040) 
just recently completed. 

We also released Test8 during the in-person session, which incorporated all 
merged PRs from the initial part of the sprint. This testnet release included 
a major update to the examples folder, making a clearer distinction between 
system contracts and demo contracts.

Looking ahead, the focus is on wrapping up the final items from the *Just Make*
scope, which are available for review in the linked [project](https://github.com/orgs/gnolang/projects/62).
Test9 is coming soon, and we’ll continue stress testing the network to ensure 
stability.

## Testnet News

While Test7 has been sunsetted, it played an important role in recent improvements.
GovDAO v3 was thoroughly tested on Test7, with seven proposals created, voted on, 
and executed on-chain. Network performance improved significantly, scaling the
validator set to 35 nodes, and external workflows are now running more smoothly 
across the board.

The [Gno.land staging network](https://gno.land) is up-to-date with the latest merges on the
monorepo, and another live network for testing your code real-time with all the 
newest features. 

## Stay in the Gno: Gnome Digest and Tech Discussions

There are several ways to stay updated with what’s happening in the Gno.land 
builder community. Gnome Digest is a weekly [roundup](https://x.com/_gnoland/status/1965445290279985630) of contributor updates,
shared on X. Every other week, we also host Tech Discussions published on 
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/b-hPHxVGuq8), where contributors share demos, the team covers key topics, and
DevRel recaps recent builder highlights. 

If you’re looking to engage directly, you’re always welcome to join our developer 
office hours every week (Thursdays) on Discord.

## Contributor Program

We recently [concluded](https://gno.land/r/gnoland/blog:p/scp-cohort-4) a Student Contributor Program (SCP) cohort, which
brought in several students from Epitech University for a six-month deep dive 
into Gno. They worked on various aspects of the project. We’ve kicked off a new 
SCP program for the second half of the year, and look forward to their contributions. 

We’re always looking for new contributors, and the best way to get started is by 
exploring the ‘good first issues’ on the repo and opening pull requests to help 
resolve them. You can also visit the Gnoverse [community repo](https://github.com/gnoverse/community) to develop 
your smart contract templates for feedback. 

## Bounty Program Update

The Gno.land Bounty Program continues to grow and evolve. It covers a range of
categories including Meta, Scoped, Competing Implementations, and Architectural 
Solutions. A new category, Security Bounties, was recently added, focusing on
providing solutions to select security issues. Developers interested in participating
can find active opportunities by searching for the "bounty" label on the Gno repository.
More information, including participation guidelines, is available in the
[Gno.land Bounties Repo](https://github.com/gnolang/bounties).


## New Workshop: Intro to Gno

At GopherCon in August, we hosted a [hands-on workshop](https://github.com/aeddi/gno-workshop) to help Go developers 
get started with Gno. The session walked attendees through building their first
Gno application step by step. It's now available online for anyone looking to 
start their journey with the Gno platform. 


So now you gno! As the team continues to work on getting Gno.land ready for
Beta Mainnet, we want to thank the entire community of gnomes around the world
for your continued support and contributions.
