Calling all gnomes and gophers! Come join the Gno.land team at GopherCon 2023, September 25 - 28, in San Diego, US. We’re sponsoring this year’s action-packed event that will gather together some of the world’s brightest minds and smartest programmers under one roof. So drop by our booth, pick up some swag, and say hey! We’ll be on hand every day to meet and greet, answer all your questions, and discuss everything Go, Gno, and beyond! We’ll also be hosting a workshop on Community Day, September 26, called ‘Chess: The Gnolang Way,’ where you can learn how to build a web3 chess server on Gno.land.

## GopherCon 2023

[GopherCon](https://www.gophercon.com/) is a community-driven annual event that started in 2014 and is dedicated to promoting the use of Go and the education of Go developers. Every year, thousands of gophers from around the world exchange ideas, share their work and expand the Go network. There are four days of fun-filled activities, including hands-on workshops, informative keynotes, networking events, and hackathons, all taking place in the laidback West Coast city of San Diego. Where better to expand your knowledge and make new friends than in one of the US’ most popular destinations?

As a gold sponsor at this year’s event, Gno.land will be running a booth and doing our best to convert as many gophers as possible to Gno, showing them how easy it is to port their existing web2 apps over to Gno.land or to build completely new ones from scratch.

## Chess: The Gnolang Way

If you’re looking for a hands-on coding experience and to have a little fun with us at the same time, join us on Community Day for an awesome workshop, **‘Chess: The Gnolang Way.’** Kickstart your day by learning to build a web3 chess server on Gno.land using Gnolang. By the end of the session, you’ll have gathered basic knowledge on developing and deploying smart contracts on Gno.land, and connecting smart contracts to a web frontend. You’ll also see how web3 enables you to write perpetual and trustable social and gaming platforms and how to build a web3 chess server and website with Gno.land.

If you want to join us, meet us at 10:00 a.m. in the Grand Ballroom 10.

## Let’s Play

After the workshop, the fun begins with an ongoing chess tournament throughout the GC23 summit for event participants. To be in with a chance of scooping up some seriously cool prizes, GC23 attendees will need to show us their best moves and how much they engage with the Gno.land chain. This competition is designed to put our platform to the test over two main areas: chess mastery (50% of points) and platform engagement (50% of points). To be eligible for prizes, participants must be present at the event. We hope to see you there! If you can’t join us in person in San Diego, be sure to [follow us on X](https://twitter.com/_gnoland). We’ll be giving updates on our progress and sharing the highlights of the event. May the best gnome win!
