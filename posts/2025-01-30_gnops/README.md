# Introducing gnops.io: The DevOps Hub for gno.land

We’ve launched the first phase of [gnops.io](http://gnops.io/), a dedicated DevOps resource hub for gno.land developers. The intent behind gnops is to provide valuable resources written by us and the broader community to empower a strong and security minded DevOps culture and team within the ecosystem. By building a comprehensive knowledge base, the content is designed to support both newcomers and experienced developers in managing secure and resilient DevOps environments.

### What is gnops.io?

gnops.io is a collection of effective essentials (Effective gnops), explainers, and best practices designed to help blockchain developers establish and maintain efficient DevOps workflows in gno.land. The key focus is on security, resilience, and automation, ensuring that teams can build and deploy with confidence. Over time, gnops.io will evolve into an ecosystem of tooling for automating, monitoring, and securing gno.land chains.

### Community-Driven Knowledge Base

A core aspect of gnops is the gnops [GitHub](https://github.com/gnoverse/gnops) repository, which serves as a community-led knowledge base. gno.land’s technology and development is highly dynamic, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to setting up DevOps environments. We’re creating a collaborative and iterative learning environment where developers share insights, refine best practices, and contribute to the evolution of DevOps in gno.land.

### Why DevOps Matters in gno.land

DevOps practices enable software development (dev) and operations (ops) teams to accelerate deployments through collaboration, feedback, and iteration. By integrating these principles into blockchain development, gnops.io and its support channels will help teams optimize their workflows, mitigate security risks, and ensure high availability for their applications.

We see the Gno DevOps family, the originators of gnops, as a community that learns together, supports each other, and cultivates a security-first culture in blockchain development. Whether you are running a complex chain on gno.land or operating as a validator, gnops.io provides guidance and tools to onboard developers quickly.

### Contributions & Future Content

As gnops.io evolves, we encourage the DevOps community to contribute content that benefits developers across all skill levels. Some suggested areas of contribution include:

- Automation scripts for managing gno.land nodes and chains
- Guides for CI/CD best practices in gno.land development
- Security audits and incident response plans for blockchain operations
- Scaling and performance tuning strategies for validators and infrastructure providers
- Case studies and war stories about DevOps challenges in blockchain

If you’re building gno.land DevOps tools, dashboards and material for the community with the relevant documentation, add them to gnops.io. In the next phase of gnops.io, we’ll be rewarding high quality documentation, content and tooling submissions that advance the overall security, infrastructure, and operations of gno.land. 

### Join the Gno DevOps Community

gnops.io is a community-driven initiative aimed at building the future of DevOps in gno.land. Whether you are a developer, operator, or validator, you’ll want to explore gnops.io and contribute to shaping  best practices for a
