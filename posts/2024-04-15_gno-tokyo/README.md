# Tokyo Meetup Recap: Getting to Gno Gno.land

This year, we're going global, connecting with various local communities in 
person to introduce them to Gno.land and the community of Gnomes working on the
project. Last week, we hosted the first-ever Gno.land community meetup in Tokyo, 
Japan. Held at the [Crypto Lounge GOX](https://cryptoloungegox.com/) in the heart
of Shinjuku City, the event drew over 20 attendees from diverse backgrounds spanning 
Web3, development, traditional business, and fintech. This meetup marked the second
in a series of in-person community events we're planning for this year, a followup 
to our recent local meetup in Korea with OnBloc
([Go to Gno](https://medium.com/onbloc/go-to-gno-recap-intro-to-the-gno-stack-with-memeland-284a43d7f620)),
which focused on introducing Gno.land to Go developers in Seoul.

These regional meetups are intentionally designed to be small and intimate, 
fostering personal relationships and building a community of trusted Gnomes 
that can influence the future of Gno.land. The content of these gatherings can 
range from introducing Gno.land and its unique concepts to guiding developers on 
how to kick start their journey with Gno. For this event in Tokyo, we covered 
three main topics:

1. What is Gno.land: an introduction to the Gno language and the platform 
2. How the Gno.land ecosystem is developing:
   3. an overview of our contributors and applications 
   4. how people can get involved, stay connected, and join the Gnome community
5. The future of Gno.land: what's coming up this year and ideas for the future

## Introduction to Gno.land

![presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnolang/blog/e338a91f47f18a62847cf68c35e450e293a50ce3/posts/2024-04-15_gno-tokyo/src/thumbs/leon-poc.png)

Leon Hudak, Gno.land's Developer Relations Engineer, was the on-site Gnome
representative and kicked things off by introducing attendees to the project's 
unique features:

- Fully Open-Source Smart-Contracting Platform: Highlighting Gno.land's commitment
to transparency and accessibility.
- Custom Smart-Contracting Language (Gno): Showcasing the innovative language
tailored for future blockchain development.
- New Consensus Protocol, Proof of Contribution: Exploring the cutting-edge 
protocol under development, emphasizing its role in supporting open-source, and 
on-chain development.

After introducing the high-level facets of Gno.land, the presentation
detailed the specifics of each one, and how it is being designed to address 
problems in both open-source development and blockchain ecosystems. For example,
the open source development culture brings immense value to the field of engineering, 
and closed source projects are often using it for their businesses. This is the
part where Proof of Contribution comes into play. We explained the idea of open 
source contributions being analyzed and how they will provide the basis for 
chain validation.

## Our Ecosystem of Gnome Contributors
We spotlighted the diverse projects and contributors bolstering the Gno.land 
ecosystem, ranging from the [Adena Wallet](https://adena.app) and
[Gnoscan](https://gnoscan.io) to innovative applications like Flippando. 
Additionally, we introduced attendees to the Gno.land
[Grants & Fund program](https://github.com/gnolang/ecosystem-fund-grants)
and the Game of Realms initiative, demonstrating various avenues for builders to
engage and contribute to the ecosystem's growth.

## The Future of Gno.land
In conclusion, we guided attendees through the development and aspirations of 
Gno.land, highlighting its growth from its origins to its present challenges 
with Test4, Mainnet, and beyond. We discussed the current emphasis 
on engineering and development to build a solid base the Gnomes of the future,
underlining the importance of Test4 — an advanced experimental testnet that 
precedes the launch of Mainnet — and what the successful implementation of Test4 
signifies for our ecosystem.

We opened up the floor for questions and answers, and the topic of Proof of 
Contribution sparked interest to understand its economic aspect and governance
architecture, as well as its comparative analysis with other popular consensus 
mechanisms.
