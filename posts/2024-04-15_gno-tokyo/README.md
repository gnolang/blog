# Tokyo Meetup Recap: Getting to Gno Gno.land

This year, we're going global, connecting with various local communities in 
person to introduce them to Gno.land and the community of Gnomes working on the
project. Last week, we hosted the first-ever Gno.land community meetup in Tokyo, 
Japan. Held at the [Crypto Lounge GOX](https://cryptoloungegox.com/) in the heart
of Shinjuku City, the event drew over 20 attendees from diverse backgrounds spanning 
Web3, development, traditional business, and fintech. This meetup marked the second
in a series of in-person community events we're planning for this year, a followup 
to our recent local meetup in Korea with OnBloc
([Go to Gno](https://medium.com/onbloc/go-to-gno-recap-intro-to-the-gno-stack-with-memeland-284a43d7f620)),
which focused on introducing Gno.land to Go developers in Seoul.

These regional meetups are intentionally designed to be small and intimate, 
fostering personal relationships and building a community of trusted Gnomes 
that can influence the future of Gno.land. The content of these gatherings can 
range from introducing Gno.land and its unique concepts to guiding developers on 
how to kick start their journey with Gno. In Tokyo, for this event we covered three
main topics:

- What is Gno.land: an introduction to the Gno language and the platform
- How the Gno.land ecosystem is developing:
  - an overview of our contributors and applications
  - how people can get involved, stay connected, and join the Gnome community

- The future of Gno.land: what's coming up this year and ideas for the future

## Introduction to Gno.land
![presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnolang/blog/49ccfd6f9c6c23ab6e3cabf4c106705b74b09313/posts/2024-04-15_gno-tokyo/src/leon-poc.png)

Leon Hudak, Gno.land's Developer Relations Engineer, was the on-site Gnome
representative and kicked things off by introducing attendees to the project's 
unique features:

-   Fully Open-Source Smart-Contracting Platform: Highlighting Gno.land's commitment
to transparency and accessibility.
-   Custom Smart-Contracting Language (Gno): Showcasing the innovative language
tailored for future blockchain development.
-   New Consensus Protocol, Proof of Contribution: Exploring the cutting-edge 
protocol under development, emphasizing its role in supporting open-source, and 
- on-chain development.

After introducing the high-level these facets of Gno.land, the presentation
detailed the specifics of each one, and how it is being designed to address 
problems in both open-source development, and blockchain ecosystems. For example,
the open source development culture brings immense value to the field of engineering, 
and closed source projects are often using it for business. This is the part Proof
of Contribution comes into play. We explained the idea of open source contributions 
being analyzed, and integrated on-chain for validation, and the different architecture
types that can be used to achieve this.

Our Ecosystem of Gnome Contributors

We spotlighted the diverse projects and contributors bolstering the Gno.land 
ecosystem, ranging from the Adena Wallet and blockchain explorer Gnoscan to 
innovative applications like Flippando. Additionally, we introduced attendees 
to the Gno.land[  Grants & Fund program](https://github.com/gnolang/ecosystem-fund-grants)
and the Game of Realms initiative, demonstrating various avenues for builders to
engage and contribute to the ecosystem's growth.

## The Future of Gno.land

In closing, we provided attendees with an exploration on the vision and journey 
of Gno.land's, tracing its evolution from inception to its current position
vis-a-vis Mainnet and beyond. We explained the current focus on engineering and
development to have a strong foundation for Gnomes of the future, and the recent 
launch of the innovative Portal Loop, and what it means for contributors. We 
emphasized the significance of Test4, an advanced experimental testnet preceding
the Mainnet launch and what the post deployment of Test4 means to our ecosystem.

We opened up the floor for questions and answers, and the topic of Proof of 
Contribution sparked interest to understand the economic, and governance 
architecture, and its comparative analysis with other popular consensus mechanisms.
We also addressed questions on collaboration with other projects, and the challenge
of fee structures for the smart contract platform, with the example of Ethereum.
