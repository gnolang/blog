Last week, we hosted the first ever Gno.land meetup in Tokyo, Japan with the
event taking place at [Crypto Lounge GOX](https://cryptoloungegox.com/) 
located in one of the city's most central points, Shinjuku City. We had 20+
attendees from a variety of backgrounds from Web3, to developers, to traditional 
business and fintech. The meetup, presented in Japanese, is part of our ongoing 
initiative to host regional, in-person opportunities for people around the world
to get to know Gno.land.

With this regional focus in mind, we hosted in March a 
[local meetup in Korea](https://medium.com/onbloc/go-to-gno-recap-intro-to-the-gno-stack-with-memeland-284a43d7f620) with
OnBloc, and introduced Gno.land to Go developer communities in Seoul.

## Introduction to Gno.land
Gno.land Developer Relations Engineer, Leon Hudak, introduced attendees to the 
project, and explained Gno.land's main features that make it unique:

- The fully open-source smart-contracting platform
- The custom smart-contracting language of the future (Gno)
- The new, under-development consensus protocol, Proof of Contribution

#### Brief overview of gno.land in Japanese

Gno.land's DevRel Engineer, Leon, covered these three topics separately,
discussing the importance of such features in open-source blockchain systems.

Leon delved into the details of Proof of Contribution, and how it connects to the 
fundamental idea of open-source, provable, on-chain development. Leon also
covered how contributions will be scored, how contributions connect to chain
validation, and how anyone can become a contributor to Gno.land.

## Our ecosystem of contributors
We spotlighted the projects and contributors building on Gno.land, and explained 
how they are directly supporting the growth of the ecosystem from the Adena Wallet,
to the blockchain explorer Gnoscan, to the first gaming app, Flippando, and an 
experiment at building a social app and network on Gno.land.

Following this, attendees were introduced to the Gno.land 
[**Grants & Fund program**](https://github.com/gnolang/ecosystem-fund-grants),
as well as a the **Game of Realms** program, presenting different ways builders 
are incentivized to build in the ecosystem at this stage.

## What is the future of Gno.land?

Finally, we gave attendees an overview of the progress on Gno.land, from its
beginnings to where we currently sit in regard to Mainnet. We explained the 
progress made over the past year of building, and how Test4, an advanced 
experimental testnet prior to launch is important as it allows us to provide
developers with a permanent, versioned, stable testnet for Gno.land. Test4 is 
planned to be the last testnet before Mainnet launch.

We shared with attendees how they can get involved now, joining Discord, 
following the project on Twitter, contributing on GitHub and researching our 
Gno.land Grants Program.

#### Intro to Gno banner on venue screens

We connected with attendees to learn more about their projects and interests to
get a better understanding of community, and get a sense of their takeways on
Gno.land. It was the case that Proof of Contribution was the most complex topic
to understand, as many attendees wondered about the fine details of the mechanism,
such as tokenomics and it's similarities and differences to other consensus
mechanisms.
