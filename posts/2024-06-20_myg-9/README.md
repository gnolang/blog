# The More You Gno 9: Realm to Realm Interaction, Faucet Hub, New Test4 Launch Date and More

This edition brings several major pieces of news; Gno Studio Connect beta, and Faucet Hub. We're moving up the Test4 launch by 2 weeks, so we could get to mainnet faster. We'll also be seeing each other at GopherCons EU and US, so make sure to stop by and say hi! Oh, and our [new gnome logo is live](https://gno.land/r/gnoland/blog:p/the-gnome)!

We're also covering all the major and minor code improvements; if you want to dive deeper, we have the weekly engineering [updates](https://github.com/gnolang/meetings/issues/37) and video [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ch7MhKNBmw&list=PL7nP7r1QiDktMCdw1ydQo2crM3y6Zk7E4) available. 

# Gno Core Updates

## Introducing Gno Studio Connect

Last month [we talked](https://medium.com/@gnostudio/introducing-gno-studio-the-premier-builder-suite-for-gno-land-d1b4d82b46de) about the need for a premier builder suite for Gno.land. As Gno.land expands into a universe of realms, we saw the need for a set of tools; tools empowing the community to create and use succint and composable realms on Gno.land. Last year we launched [Gno Playground](https://play.gno.land/). Now we're adding another tool to the toolbox - [Gno Studio Connect](https://gno.studio/connect). Currently in beta, Connect allows seamless access to realms, making it simple to explore, interact, and engage with Gno.land's smart contracts through function calls. Try out your first realm interaction via Connect by taking our [gnoyourdate](https://gno.studio/connect/view/gno.land/r/gnostudio/gnoyourdate?network=test3#Vote) poll. 

## Faucet Hub is Live

With the [Faucet Hub](https://faucet.gno.land) you can now easily and effortlessly use all Gno.land ecosystem faucets, including Portal Loop, staging, future testnets and implementation partner chains. It's easily extensible, with the goal of having a single stop for every possible Gno.land test token you might need.

## Test4 Launch Scheduled for July 15

After announcing the tentative [Test4](https://gno.land/r/gnoland/blog:p/test4-explained) launch for the end of July/early August, we realized we're working faster than anticipated. That's why **we're moving the official Test4 launch to July 15, 2024**!

## 550 TPS

Recent [supernova](https://github.com/gnolang/supernova) tests showed that we have **~550 TPS** on a single node machine (M3 Mac; 100k txs, 1s block time). This is a huge step up from last year, when the TPS performance we had varied from 7-20 TPS with the same setup.

## New DevOps team member

Please welcome Sergio Matone! A DevOps with a strong Go background, he'll be a key player in improving and managing the Gno.land infrastructure.

## Belgrade Retreat

The core team travelled from across the world to Belgrade, Serbia, where we hunkered down and solved a number of issues blocking Test4 as well as future releases all the way to the mainnet. Full recap [here](https://gno.land/r/gnoland/blog:p/gnomes-in-serbia).

## Changelog

- Dropped support for [all unused DB implementations](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1714), apart from leveldb and boltdb. Without excessive DB implementations that need maintaining, we can focus on optimizing the ones we actually use, and squeeze out performance from systems we already have. 

- Resolved a Long Standing CI Issue With BFT Tests. [The CI is finally green across the board](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1515). We still have some flaky tests, but the CI will no longer constantly fail on the BFT CI due to irregular channel usage. This, couple with our CI rework over the past month, significantly improved our GitHub development process.

- Lots of spring cleaning efforts with [gnokey](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1212), [gnoland](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1985), and our other tools. We took this chance to also add extensive coverage and regression tests, in case they were missing before.

- [Finally merged in Event / Emit support](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1653) in Gno! Users and Gno clients can finally fetch on-chain events as soon as they happen, and have a rich context for them as well. Support for these has already been propagated to our [tx-indexer](https://github.com/gnolang/tx-indexer/pull/43).

- [Merged in the VM gas consumption fixes](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1430), which standardize VM gas usage across the board for users. Having predictable gas costs, and gas costs that take into account VM operations is only fair for both the node operators and the chain users.

- [Reworked the node directory structure](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1944), and made [genesis.json usage explicit](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1972), paving the way to an easier multinode future. This effort enables us to easily orchestrate and configure Gno blockchain nodes, especially with the upcoming devnet / testnet launch.

- [Overhauled our monorepo GH actions](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/2040), with them now avoiding double-work, and being much snappier. CI for PRs now runs much quicker and more stable, due to these optimizations.

- [Finished migration to Goreleaser](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/2101). All of our important tools and binaries have a clear build and release schedule (for Docker, and beyond!), with us implementing nightly, dev and `master` releases on the monorepo.

- [Bumped the gnovm test coverage](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/2143) from ~34% to ~67%. With upcoming changes to the GnoVM, we needed a good safety net in the form of a testing suite that will alert us if funny business is going on after a change.

- [Many, many bug fixes, small UX improvements and QoL changes](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/commits/master/?since=2024-05-01&until=2024-06-03&before=edb321f85beff98536a3a1a7111febaea0771a5e+35) that keep the lights on and systems running smoothly.
