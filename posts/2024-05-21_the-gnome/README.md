# Introducing our new Gno.land logo: the gnome

We are excited to introduce our new Gno.land logo, a significant shift that 
reflects the true spirit of our project.

From the very beginning, the character of the "gnome" has been a source of 
inspiration for gno.land, representing the essence of our journey and values 
going forward.
Over time, this character has not only inspired our project but has also become
part of gno.land’s identity.

The black hole of the previous logo represented finality, inevitability, the
ultimate end state, and was an interesting representation of something that cannot
be seen; but it also arguably represented something like an unemotional void. In
contrast, gnomes are warm and inviting in character, and so much more.

_So why gnomes?_

In Greek, _gnomi_ means “the means of knowing; mind; intelligence; judgment”. 
_Gnomic poetry_ refers to a type of poetry involving short memorable maxims of 
wisdom that flourished in the 6th century in Greece. Today, when we hear _gnome_ 
we think of earth-dwelling figures often found in lush blue-green gardens,
guarding or simply enjoying the land they are in.

Nobody knows for sure the origin of these gnomes, but the earliest known
reference to it comes from Paracelsus as _gnomus_, a Swiss Christian theologian, 
philosopher and alchemist of the Renaissance. He also called them _pygmies_ in 
his _“A book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders, and on Other Spirits”_
published in 1566, a study on myth creatures as they relate to Christianity.

While the depiction of gnomes are varied, their general character was described
by Paracelsus:

_“the Pygmies (gnomes) are mountain people who keep pledges, are honest, hard 
working, loyal to man, and have money, because they themselves coin it”_

(perhaps Paracelsus would have preferred to be identified as a gnome, since he was also an alchemist).

This character is consistent with Swiss folklore, as gnomes are said to have 
caused the landslide that destroyed the Swiss village of Plurs in 1618 - the
villagers had become wealthy from a local gold mine created by the gnomes, who
had poured liquid gold down into a vein for the benefit of humans. The villagers
were corrupted by this newfound prosperity, which greatly offended the Gnomes.

In addition, gnomes are not afraid to stand up against greed and evil. Some say 
that gnomes wear the Phrygian cap, which represents Zoroaster, the “three Magi” 
from the east, or the revolutionary pursuit of liberty. Gnomes are also earth 
dwellers, masons of the rock, and the guardians of the land.

By combining the above descriptions, we can describe gnomes in the following manner:

1. Gnomes create timeless value for humanity.
2. But since humanity becomes corrupted through greed and abuses these timeless 
values, gnomes also take remedial action.

Whether the timeless value is that of an element such as gold, or that of a 
blockchain protocol, gnomes are hardworking alchemists who seek the best for 
humanity and actively resist greed and corruption as a matter of principle. This
quality of character is greatly needed in the blockchain/web3 field, where it is 
so easy to become blinded by greed, resulting in stalled innovation, broken 
promises, sometimes the loss of life savings, and the demise of entire web3 
communities.

The blockchain world needs more gnomes to create timeless software and protocols
for the benefit of humanity. Such technology should be:

1. intuitive (easy to use and understand)
2. expressive (for societal infrastructure, finance, social, knowledge)
3. finalized (completed)
4. secure (unhackable)
5. scalable (affordable)

This is what we seek to bring to the world through gno.land.

Gnomes are thus an excellent representation of the builders behind gno.land. We
hope you like the new logo – an iconic depiction of the gnome with cap – and hope
that the gnomic spirit can help guide us to build a better, more honest world for
all of us.

_- the gnomes of gno.land_
