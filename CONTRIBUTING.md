# Contributing to the Gno Blog

Thank you for considering a contribution to the Gno Blog. We appreciate all and every open-source contribution to the Gno.land project, as everything we do revolves around open-source. 
Below, you will find guidelines on how to submit a blog post to the Gno Blog.

If you are unsure about something, please don’t hesitate to reach out for help by opening an issue here, on Discord, or directly to the Gno.land DevRel team.
Likewise, if you have an idea on how to improve this guide, go for it as well.

### What we are looking for
We’re seeking contributions that will bring value to our growing community of gnomes. If you can bring technical expertise or a different perspective to the table, we want to hear from you. Please ensure your article is written in high-quality text and formatted according to the specifications below. We don’t tolerate plagiarism, excessive self-promotion, link spamming, SEO stuffing, or hate speech.  

Below are topics of particular interest to us, but we’re open to all suggestions, so if you have an idea that’s not on the list, but you believe will make great reading, feel free to submit your story.

- Web3 news and developments and how they impact our community (e.g. legislation, industry trends, technical advances)
- Gno ecosystem news (e.g. interesting new realms/apps, newly-added core functionality, etc.)
- Technical deep dives (e.g. language comparisons, pros and cons, examining the core stack)
- Tutorials and how-to guides
- Useful intros about basic concepts in Gno.land (e.g. package/realm distinction)
- General content that helps explain reasoning or thought processes (e.g. writing the entire stack in Go vs implementing components in Rust)
- Op-ed pieces and alternative views (e.g. building effective governance, decentralizing social media, the importance of censorship-resistant tools)

## Gno Blog Style Guide

This style guide offers rules and preferences for contributing to the Gno Blog.

1. All Gno Blog posts are written in standard Markdown. Follow the formatting for headers, links, bold, italic, strikethrough, etc. as you usually would.
2. Check your content for spelling and grammatical mistakes before submitting.
3. Use the Oxford comma.
4. Make sure the target reader is addressed consistently.
5. Make sure the product, company, tech, and other names are accurate.
6. Fact-check your content.
7. If your post contains images, please add a `src` folder to contain them, and link to them in Markdown.
8. Include front-matter in your blog post, detailing the following:
    1. Title
    2. Publication date
    3. Slug
    4. [Tags](#tags)
    5. Authors

#### Tags
Tags, or [hashtags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag), should be lowercase and without spaces; eg, #foobar NOT #FooBar.
